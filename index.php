                    <h1>PMCI</h1>
                    <P>Philippine Malabon Cultural Institute was established on February 06, 1958, by a consortium of
                        civic-minded Chinese-Filipino businessmen in Malabon, the Philippine Malabon Chinese School,
                        under the leadership of Mr. Co San, initially provided a comprehensive Elementary Course.
                        Generous contributions from Mr. Ke Eng Chay and Mr. Lim Gui Lui facilitated the construction of
                        a Kindergarten building on March 10, 1961, thereby expanding educational opportunities.
                        Subsequently, Mr. Lim Se Keng's funding enabled the extension of the main building,
                        accommodating over 800 students by May 10, 1964.
                        In 1973, the institution underwent reconstitution and was rechristened the Philippine Malabon
                        Cultural Institute, aligning itself with prevailing national directives. Over ensuing decades,
                        visionary leaders such as Mr. Samuel Malapas and Mr. Charlie Ang spearheaded expansions,
                        including the establishment of an auditorium and a high school department. Continuing this
                        illustrious tradition, the current Chairman, Mr. Jason Choa, initiated groundbreaking for a new
                        school edifice on March 16, 2021.
                        PMCI remains steadfast in its dedication to instilling values of excellence and fostering
                        bilingual proficiency among its students, drawing from a wealth of experience spanning over 60
                        years of educational endeavors.</P>
